## Security notice

**NOTE**: As a security notice, We declare that, we're not storing the sensitive tokens, We just store the 
access tokens securely, used for generating temporary refresh tokens, and getting just the status data, with 
only read permissions and scopes. You can check it in the configuration file for the scopes.

## Setting up the development environment

#### Install the dependencies

The project uses pipenv for dependencies. Here's how to install the dependencies.

```sh
pipenv sync -d
```

#### Setting up spotify

- Go to the developer panel at spotify. [Link](https://developer.spotify.com)
- Make an APP, Specify the name, and description.
- Add `http://localhost:5000/callback` to the URLs
- Take a note of the Client ID, and Client Secret for setting up `.env`

#### Setting up Firebase

- Go to the firebase panel.
- Make a new project, and setup as a Web SDK and enable it.
- Go to Settings, and the web apps section, and copy the config, and keep a note.
- Then go to the `Services account` tab, then the `Database secrets`, select the Database we're 
  using and copy the API.
- Copy the domain from Realtime Database section in left, after initializing it.

#### Setting up .env

Configure the environmental variables by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env` with the respective 
values for it.

Here's the info about the variables
